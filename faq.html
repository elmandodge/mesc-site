          <h4>What are the characteristics of ( roll on / roll off ) ships?</h4>
          <p>Ro-Ro ships are vessels designed to transport vehicles on wheels, i.e. cars, trucks or
            industrial vehicles.</p>
          <p>Sometimes they have built-in ramps for the loading and unloading of vehicles.
            The fact that the cargo can access the ship under its own steam removes the need for a crane, thus reducing
            the intermediary costs related to loading, unloading and stowage.
            These ships can only carry wheeled vehicles and mustn’t be confused with Ro-Pax vessels, like ferries, which
            combine the transport of vehicles and passengers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-10 scroll-snap">
          <h4>What is the purpose of a ( roll on / roll off ) ship?</h4>
          <p>To transport wheeled cargo, such as all kinds of vehicles and machinary with wheels. The cargo can be
            loaded using the ramp, with no need for cranes or intermediaries, thereby making for lower costs and risks.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-10 scroll-snap">
          <h4>What are container ships?</h4>
          <p>Vessels designed to transport freight in containers. They monopolize the majority of international dry
            cargo transport and represent more than half of all maritime trade. They are intended to transport standard
            containers according to ISO regulations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-10 scroll-snap">
          <h4>What is a ship agent?</h4>
          <p>A ship agent is an independent shipping agent who acts on behalf of the ship owner. Ship agents are
            responsible for a ship when it comes into port and conduct all of the procedures required to streamline its
            dock time in order to reduce the cost of the operation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-10 scroll-snap">
          <h4>What is multimodal freight transport?</h4>
          <p>Multimodal transport consists of carrying a single cargo by different modes of transport (air, land,
            ocean…) using Intermodal Transport Units (ITU) such as containers, semi-trailers or swap bodies
            (interchangeable containers).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h4>How many types of storage facilities are there?</h4>
          <p>For the purposes of duty and tax, we have two different kinds of warehouses, the CW and the WAOC:</p>
          <div style="margin-left: 12px;">
            <p style="color: #555;">1 - ( Customs Warehouse ) (CW): This is a space where goods can be stored for an
              unlimited period of
              time,
              during which duty and tax payments are suspended. Goods will only become liable for duty and tax when they
              leave the premises again. It is an excellent option for companies with a medium-low inventory turnover,
              but
              who need to have stock on hand.</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">2 - ( Warehouse Authorisation Others than Customs ) (WAOC): Also known as a tax
              warehouse, this is
              another
              place where goods can be kept for an unlimited time, offering advantageous conditions for the storage of
              goods imported within the EU, with no need to pay VAT in advance.</p>
          </div>
          <p>These terms mustn’t be confused with the concept of storage in a free warehouse or open-air warehouse,
            since both can function as a CW and WAOC.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h4>What is the difference between a forwarding and a customs agent?</h4>
          <p>A forwarding agent or forwarder is a transport operator. They act on behalf and in favour of importers and
            exporters, organising safe, efficient and economical goods transport. In other words, a professional expert
            at your disposal for the purposes of hiring transport, selecting the most efficient route, taking out
            insurance policies, choosing the appropriate packaging and taking care of storage where required.</p>
          <p>A customs agent is responsible for managing all customs duties and documents required by the tax
            administration in every country for the traffic of goods between states. Their importance lies in knowing
            the legal regulations in order to satisfy the tax authorities and avoid last-minute surprises such as tax
            duties or surcharges.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h4>How many kinds of customs controls are there?</h4>
          <p>The main kinds of customs controls according to the route and jurisdiction are as follows:</p>
          <div style="margin-left: 12px;">
            <p style="color: #555;">* Land customs: Are found at the borders between countries, where they deal with
              heavy goods transport, private cars and even people who cross on foot in the case of city border points.
              Their functions are to check that the documentation matches the articles transported.</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">* Air customs: Are located at international airports and deal with the highest
              flow of human transit. Imported and exported goods arriving at an airport are checked by customs on
              arrival, and subsequently by customs at the place of their destination</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">* Maritime customs: This kind of customs deals with the vast amount of goods
              travelling between countries geographically very distant from one another. Here the goods are generally of
              great weight or size, such as vehicles or industrial machinery. Maritime customs are responsible for
              verifying the goods entering and leaving, as well as their documentation.</p>
          </div>
          <p>On the other hand, depending on their function, customs controls can be classified as:</p>
          <div style="margin-left: 12px;">
            <p style="color: #555;">* Customs at the port of entry: Which deal with goods to be declared for national
              consumption.</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">* Customs at the point of destination: Receive goods or products sent. At this
              point the goods are no longer considered as being in transit and become liable for tax.</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">* Border customs: These are customs which neither receive nor issue goods, but
              control goods in transit, often when travelling from their country of origin to that of their
              destination.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h4>How do customs controls work?</h4>
          <p>Customs control the movement of goods between different states in three steps:</p>
          <div style="margin-left: 12px;">
            <p style="color: #555;">1. Customs declaration: Must be presented to the customs authority in order to
              identify the goods to be transported and their destination.</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">2. Goods inspection by the customs agents, to check that they match the
              declaration.</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">3. Verification that trade policy norms have been met and amounts due have been
              paid (import and export duties).</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h4>What is the purpose of international customs?</h4>
          <p>The role of customs control is to regulate and inspect shipments in order to guarantee that commercial
            exchanges between different countries proceed legally, that they comply with all tax and duty obligations
            and with all other requirements related to their entry or exit.</p>
          <p>As well as guaranteeing compliance with international trade rules, collecting taxes and duties due where
            appropriate, customs controls are a fundamental mechanism for preventing money laundering, tax fraud and
            drug trafficking.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h4>What is customs management?</h4>
          <p>The management of all formalities required by the customs authorities. It is important for these
            formalities to run smoothly and trouble-free in order to prevent delays due to bureaucratic issues. These
            formalities are therefore usually entrusted to a customs agent who will carry them out on behalf of the
            freight owner.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h4>What is customs clearance?</h4>
          <p>All formalities and requirements to be completed for goods entering and leaving a specific national
            territory in order to control and approve their transportation. The customs agent is responsible for
            completing these formalities on behalf of the importer or exporter, and for submitting a declaration of
            information to the competent customs authority in each case.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h4>What is completed customs clearance?</h4>
          <p>Customs clearance means that the customs procedure has been completed, i.e. that all of the paperwork has
            been submitted and that the shipment can continue on its way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h4>How are dangerous or IMO goods classified?</h4>
          <p>Dangerous goods are classified according to the ADR (European Agreement concerning the International
            Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road), as follows:</p>
          <div style="margin-left: 12px;">
            <p style="color: #555;">Class 1: Explosive substances and articles</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">Class 2: Gases</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">Class 3: Flammable liquids</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">Class 4.1: Flammable solids</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">Class 4.2: Substances liable to spontaneous combustion</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">Class 4.3: Substances which, in contact with water, emit flammable gases</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">Class 5.1: Oxidizing substances</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">Class 5.2: Organic peroxides</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">Class 6.1: Toxic substances</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">Class 6.2: Infectious substances</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">Class 7: Radioactive materials</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">Class 8: Corrosive substances</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">Class 9: Miscellaneous dangerous substances and articles</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h4>Who regulates dangerous substances?</h4>
          <p>There are different regulations on dangerous substances.</p>
          <div style="margin-left: 12px;">
            <p style="color: #555;">The road transport regulation is the ADR (European Agreement concerning the
              International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road), an agreement including 32 EU countries.</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">The carriage of dangerous goods by rail is governed by the RID.</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">For the ocean carriage of dangerous goods, the IMDG (International Maritime
              Dangerous Goods) code applies. Here such cargoes are also known as IMO goods due to the fact that the
              International Maritime Organization is the authority in the matter.</p>
            <p style="color: #555;">Finally, the ICAO provides the regulation for the air transport of dangerous goods.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h4>What are the risks of maritime freight transport?</h4>
          <p>• Delayed shipment: The most common causes of delay are inefficient management of port times and
            formalities. Other variables may also affect the shipment, such as circumstances of force majeure, like a
            storm for instance, or, in some parts of the world, the risk of a pirate attack.</p>
          <p>• Lost goods: While this represents a very low risk today, it can occur in the event of problems such as
            the boat sinking or breaking down, as well as due to robbery or theft in ports of loading and destination in
            countries with high levels of corruption.</p>
          <p>• Moisture, humidity or extreme temperatures: Environmental conditions must be perfectly controlled to
            prevent the cargo from being rendered unusable due to moisture, humidity or extreme heat or cold. All cargo
            must therefore be transported in containers suited to their particular characteristics and checked to ensure
            that they are properly closed. They must also be correctly loaded, unloaded and stored.</p>
          <p>• Contamination: Interaction between different goods can ruin them. The goods must therefore be well
            packaged and properly stowed in the hold to prevent their contamination.</p>
          <p>• Natural disasters: Natural disasters are becoming more frequent and serious in recent years; this
            represents the most unpredictable risk on the list.</p>
          <p>• Computer threats: This is one of the new risks of international maritime transport since the famous
            “NotPeya attack” suffered by Maersk. Companies and ports are therefore currently working on logistics
            cybersecurity</p>

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 60px;font-weight: bold;">Incoterms</h2>
        <p>The Incoterms or International Commercial Terms are a series of pre-defined commercial terms published by the
          International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) relating to international commercial law. They are widely used in
          international commercial transactions or procurement processes and their use is encouraged by trade councils,
          courts and international lawyers. A series of three-letter trade terms related to common contractual sales
          practices, the Incoterms rules are intended primarily to clearly communicate the tasks, costs, and risks
          associated with the global or international transportation and delivery of goods. Incoterms inform sales
          contracts defining respective obligations, costs, and risks involved in the delivery of goods from the seller
          to the buyer, but they do not themselves conclude a contract, determine the price payable, currency or credit
          terms, govern contract law or define where title to goods transfers.
          The Incoterms rules are accepted by governments, legal authorities, and practitioners worldwide for the
          interpretation of most commonly used terms in international trade. They are intended to reduce or remove
          altogether uncertainties arising from the differing interpretations of the rules in different countries. As
          such they are regularly incorporated into sales contracts worldwide.
          "Incoterms" is a registered trademark of the ICC.
          The first work published by the ICC on international trade terms was issued in 1923, with the first edition
          known as Incoterms published in 1936. The Incoterms rules were amended in 1953, 1967, 1976, 1980, 1990,
          2000, and 2010, with the ninth version — Incoterms 2020 — having been published on September 10, 2019.

      <h4>What does ( EXW - EX Works - named place or origin ) mean?</h4><br>
      <div class="incoterms"> <i class="fa fa-certificate"></i>
        <p>The seller makes the goods available at their premises, or at another named place. This term places the
          maximum obligation on the buyer and minimum obligations on the seller. The Ex Works term is often used while
          making an initial quotation for the sale of goods without any costs included.
          EXW means that a buyer incurs the risks for bringing the goods to their final destination. Either the seller
          does not load the goods on collecting vehicles and does not clear them for export, or if the seller does load
          the goods, he does so at buyer's risk and cost. If the parties agree that the seller should be responsible for
          the loading of the goods on departure and to bear the risk and all costs of such loading, this must be made
          clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale.
          There is no obligation for the seller to make a contract of carriage, but there is also no obligation for the
          buyer to arrange one either - the buyer may sell the goods on to their own customer for collection from the
          original seller's warehouse. However, in common practice the buyer arranges the collection of the freight from
          the designated location, and is responsible for clearing the goods through Customs. The buyer is also
          responsible for completing all the export documentation, although the seller does have an obligation to obtain
          information and documents at the buyer's request and cost.
          These documentary requirements may result in two principal issues. Firstly, the stipulation for the buyer to
          complete the export declaration can be an issue in certain jurisdictions (not least the European Union) where
          the customs regulations require the declarant to be either an individual or corporation resident within the
          jurisdiction. If the buyer is based outside of the customs jurisdiction they will be unable to clear the goods
          for export, meaning that the goods may be declared in the name of the seller by the buyer, even though the
          export formalities are the buyer's responsibility under the EXW term.
          Secondly, most jurisdictions require companies to provide proof of export for tax purposes. In an EXW
          shipment, the buyer is under no obligation to provide such proof to the seller, or indeed to even export the
          goods. In a customs jurisdiction such as the European Union, this would leave the seller liable to a sales tax
          bill as if the goods were sold to a domestic customer. It is therefore of utmost importance that these matters
          are discussed with the buyer before the contract is agreed. It may well be that another Incoterm, such as FCA
          seller's premises, may be more suitable, since this puts the onus for declaring the goods for export onto the
          seller, which provides for more control over the export process

        <h4>What does ( DAP - delivery at place ) mean?</h4><br>
        <i class="fa fa-certificate"></i>
        <p>If a delivery is sent on a DAP basis, the seller is responsible for the delivery of the goods including
          transport costs to the named destination at the buyer. The costs of carrying out all the necessary import
          formalities are expressly excluded. These are borne by the buyer, meaning that all taxes incurred when
          importing to the country of destination must be paid by the buyer or the recipient.
          What does this mean for foreign customers? If VAT and/or customs are higher than the exemption limits, all
          duties must be paid on the doorstep upon receipt of the consignment. If the recipient is not present at the
          delivery or the outstanding amount cannot be paid, a collection invitation will be left for the shipment.
          Please note: If you do not clearly communicate the Incoterm DAP to your customers when ordering in the online
          shop, the customs duties are likely to annoy them.

      <div class="incoterms" style="margin-top: 65px;">
        <h4>What does ( DDP - delivered duty paid ) mean?</h4><br>
        <i class="fa fa-certificate"></i>
        <p>For a delivery based on DDP (delivered duty paid), the seller must deliver the goods at their own expense and
          risk to a destination in the import country, taking care of all formalities and paying all import duties in
          addition to all costs. DDP is essentially same as DAP with additional customs and tax processing. What does
          this mean for foreign customers? They no longer have to pay anything on receipt, the goods are delivered as if
          they were a national delivery. In this variant, the shipping agent has the goods cleared in the EU by a
          partner such as Asendia. Thereafter, no further customs duties or value added tax must be paid.</p>

      <div class="incoterms" style="margin-top: 65px;">
        <h4>What does ( FOB - Free On Board - named port of loading ) mean?</h4><br>
        <i class="fa fa-certificate"></i>
        <p>Under FOB terms the seller bears all costs and risks up to the point the goods are loaded on board the
          vessel. The seller's responsibility does not end at that point unless the goods are "appropriated to the
          contract" that is, they are "clearly set aside or otherwise identified as the contract goods. Therefore, FOB
          contract requires a seller to deliver goods on board a vessel that is to be designated by the buyer in a
          manner customary at the particular port. In this case, the seller must also arrange for export clearance. On
          the other hand, the buyer pays cost of marine freight transportation, bill of lading fees, insurance,
          unloading and transportation cost from the arrival port to destination. Since Incoterms 1980 introduced the
          Incoterm FCA, FOB should only be used for non-containerized sea freight and inland waterway transport.
          However, FOB is commonly used incorrectly for all modes of transport despite the contractual risks that this
          can introduce. In some common law countries such as the United States of America, FOB is not only connected
          with the carriage of goods by sea but also used for inland carriage aboard any "vessel, car or other vehicle.
